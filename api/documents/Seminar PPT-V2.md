Satellite-Based Precipitation Nowcasting with Deep Learning

Section I – Introduction and Motivation

Why Precipitation Nowcasting Matters?

Life-critical applications:  Essential for protecting lives and livelihoods in flood-prone regions, especially in vulnerable communities exposed to rapidly developing storms

What is Precipitation Nowcasting ?

Short-term prediction of rainfall or snow, up to a few hours ahead

What is Traditional Nowcasting ?

Nowcasting refers to the estimation of the current and very near-future state of a variable using incomplete, high-frequency, or partially observed data available in real time.

Satellite-Based Precipitation Nowcasting with Deep Learning

- Global coverage via multi-satellite fusion:  Inputs from 7 geostationary satellites covering Europe, Africa, Asia, the Americas, and oceans are combined to provide global coverage 
- Operational time characteristics:  Mosaics generated every 30 minutes, with ~1 hour total latency (data delivery + processing)
